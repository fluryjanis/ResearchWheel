## Key Features & Gestures

### Features

* **8-Octant Radial Wheel:** Drag-to-select radial menu triggered via middle-click. It provides immediate access to search actions, note clipping, and citation generation.
* **Unified Workspace Sidebar:** A native Firefox sidebar that displays your saved notes, clipped quotes, and generated citations.
* **Advanced Citation Engine:** Generates citations on-the-fly for APA 7th, MLA 9th, Chicago 17th, and BibTeX.
* **Proper Noun Engine:** Applies sentence-casing rules to article titles while preserving proper nouns (e.g., U.S. states, political entities, names) and dynamically stripping possessives with straight, curly, or backtick apostrophes.
* **Tagline and Brand Stripper:** Strips generic site tags (such as `: NPR` or `- NBC News`) from scraped webpage headers.
* **Dual-Mode Homepage Detector:** Identifies root or localized homepages to cleanly override taglines with organizational group publishers.

### Radial Wheel Gesture Mappings

* **🎓 Scholar Search (NORTH):** Launches a Google Scholar search using your highlighted text (or webpage title if no text is selected).
* **🧬 PubMed (NORTH-EAST):** Launches a PubMed search using your highlight or title.
* **📝 Append Note (EAST):** Clips selected text directly to your Workspace sidebar as a general research note.
* **📜 Citation (SOUTH-EAST):** Formats, saves, and copies a citation of the page using your active style preference (APA, MLA, Chicago, or BibTeX).
* **📂 Workspace (SOUTH):** Commands the background script to open the sidebar. If Gecko blocking policies restrict programmatic opening, a page-level toast prompts you to use the shortcut.
* **🌐 Translate (SOUTH-WEST):** Translates the leading text containers on the webpage in-place using translation engines.
* **🔗 Title + URL (WEST):** Copies a clean markdown hyperlink `[Page Title](URL)` directly to your clipboard.
* **📋 Quote + Source (NORTH-WEST):** Copies and saves highlighted text as a blockquote along with its markdown-formatted source attribution.

## Why Research Wheel?

* **Preserves Native Autoscroll:** Quick middle-clicks are handled smoothly without interfering with native browser scrolling behaviors.
* **Autoscroll & Deselection Mitigation:** Synchronously captures text highlights on `mousedown` before Firefox can natively clear selection buffers or trigger autoscroll behavior.
* **Scroll & Key Blocking:** Temporarily suspends scroll events, touch moves, and keyboard navigation keys (`Space`, `Arrows`, `PageUp`/`PageDown`) when the radial wheel is active to prevent shifts in webpage positioning.
* **100% Private:** Operates entirely locally on your device with zero data collection, analytics, or external tracking.
